This module creates something that is "pretty close to an ELT pupil". The pupil
details (outer edges of the segments, gaps, support of spider arms) are very
small structures that will end up being severely undersampled due to the very
coarse sampling that is used in the context of phase diversity. Therefore the
ELT pupil has been simplified, it is a dodecagon with an alternation of edges of
different lengths, equivalent to the intersection at 90Â° of two hexagons H1 and
H2 of different sizes. One outer hexagon (H1) is 18.6252 m in "radius" (series
of triangles), the other (H2) is 18.732 m (series of trapezes). The central
obscuration is of H1 type, 4.846 m. The f/d of the ELT is given for a diameter
of 38.542 m.

Coordinates comply with the "Standard Coordinate Systems and Basic Conventions
ESO-193058 v6 2015.12.03" in the context of the "[x,y] convention" coding.
